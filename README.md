# Satellite Orbit Simulation using RK4

**Author:** Sanyam Kukreja  
**Date:** October 2025  

## Project Overview
This project simulates the 2D orbit of a satellite around Earth using the **Rungeâ€“Kutta 4th order (RK4) integration method**. It calculates key orbital parameters, including **semi-major axis, orbital period, and eccentricity**, and visualizes the satellite's trajectory around the Earth.  

The simulation demonstrates skills in:  
- **Python programming**  
- **Numerical methods and simulation**  
- **Orbital mechanics and aerospace concepts**  
- **Data visualization with Matplotlib**

## Features
- Calculates semi-major axis, orbital period, and eccentricity of the orbit  
- Simulates orbital trajectory using Newtonian mechanics  
- Generates a 2D plot of the satellite orbit with Earth shown for scale  
- Modular code structure for easy experimentation and extension

## Installation & Dependencies
This project requires **Python 3** and the following packages:  
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
